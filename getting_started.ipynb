There is a community-driven effort called the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), which provides more up to date packages. To enable us to access the most up to date version of the Python packages we are going to use, we will add the more up to date channel.

    "[A virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system.  For example, you may want a certain version of tensorflow for one project but another version for a different project. Virtual environments helps us to build environment isolation between different projects and make sure any change to dependencies affects only the projects that need it.\n",
